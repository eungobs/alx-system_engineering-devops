## Introduction

Project 0x09 is a web application that serves as [brief description of your project].

## System Architecture

Our web infrastructure is designed to be highly available, scalable, and secure. The architecture consists of the following key components:

- **Load Balancer:** We use a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers. This ensures high availability and even distribution of traffic.

- **Web Servers:** Our web servers are responsible for serving the web application to end-users. They are set up in an auto-scaling group to handle varying traffic loads.

- **Database Servers:** We use database servers to store and manage the application's data. We've set up master-slave replication for high availability and data redundancy.

- **Caching Layer:** To improve performance, we employ a caching layer using [caching technology, e.g., Redis]. This reduces the load on the database and speeds up data retrieval.

- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** To serve static assets and reduce latency, we utilize a CDN. This ensures fast content delivery to users across the globe.
